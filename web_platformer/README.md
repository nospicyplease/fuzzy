# Web Platformer

A simple side-scrolling platformer that runs entirely in the browser. Open
`index.html` in any modern browser to play. Use the arrow keys to move and jump.
Reach the green flag to win.

Add your own images in the `assets` folder if desired. The game will use colored
rectangles as placeholders.
