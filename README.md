# Fuzzy

A collection of small experiments. There are two games in this repository:

- `cosmic_invader` – a browser-based shooter
- `platformer` – a simple Mario-style platformer built with Pygame

To run the platformer without changing directories, execute:

```bash
python run_platformer.py
```

See each subfolder for more information.
