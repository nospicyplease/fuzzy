# Fuzzy

A collection of small experiments. The `cosmic_invader` package now contains a simple browser-based shooter game. The repo also includes a basic Pygame platformer.

To play the platformer, make sure Pygame is installed and run:

```
python run_platformer.py
```

See `cosmic_invader/README.md` for details on the browser shooter.
