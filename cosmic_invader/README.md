# Cosmic Invader

This is a simple terminal-based shooter inspired by classic space invader games.

## How to Run

Run the game using Python 3 in a terminal that supports curses:

```bash
python -m cosmic_invader.game
```

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the ship. Press the spacebar to fire and `q` to quit. Destroy all aliens before any reach your position to win the game.
