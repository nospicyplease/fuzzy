# Cosmic Invader

Cosmic Invader is a small shooter game that now runs directly in the browser using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to start the game. Use the left and right arrow keys to move your ship, press the spacebar to fire, and `w` to toggle between laser and bomb weapons.

A basic terminal version still exists and can be launched with:

```bash
python -m cosmic_invader.game
```
