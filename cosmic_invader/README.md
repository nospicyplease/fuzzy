# Cosmic Invader

Cosmic Invader is a small browser shooter inspired by the arcade classic. Move your ship with the arrow keys and press the spacebar to blast aliens. Avoid incoming bombs and survive until all aliens are destroyed.

## How to Play

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. Use the left and right arrow keys to move and the spacebar to fire. If an alien bomb hits you or the aliens reach the bottom, the game ends.
