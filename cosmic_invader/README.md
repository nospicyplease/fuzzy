# Cosmic Invader

A lightweight shooter inspired by classic space invaders. The game now runs entirely in the browser and includes two levels of increasing difficulty.

## How to Play

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. Use the left and right arrow keys to move your ship and press the spacebar to fire. Clear all aliens to advance to the next level. Survive both levels to win the game.

No additional setup is required.
